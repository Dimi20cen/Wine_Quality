# Wine_Quality
Predicting the quality of wine with ML

## Problem Description

This project aims to predict the quality of wine based on various physicochemical properties.  This is a **supervised learning** problem, specifically both a **regression** and **classification** task.

**Goal:** The primary goal is to build a model that can accurately predict a wine's quality score (on a scale) given its chemical composition.  We will explore different machine learning models to determine which performs best for this prediction task.  A secondary goal is to identify which features are most influential in determining wine quality. This is important for understanding the factors that contribute to high-quality wine, which could be useful for winemakers and consumers. We are trying to predict wine quality.

**Dataset:** Can be found on Kaggle. It contains 12 features including quality and 1143 samples.

**Type of Learning:** Supervised Learning
**Type of Task:** Regression and Classification
